# Portion Size Guide 📏

## Why Portion Sizes?

Most people don't carry a kitchen scale everywhere. This app lets you log food using **realistic, everyday portions** instead of exact gram measurements.

## Quick Reference

### 🥤 Drinks
- **1 cup** = 240ml (standard coffee/tea cup)
- Use for: lattes, iced drinks, juice, smoothies, milk

### 🍔 Individual Items  
- **1 piece** = ~50g (one complete item)
- Use for: sandwiches, burgers, whole fruits, pastries, cookies

### 🍗 Protein Servings
- **1 serving** = ~100g (restaurant-style portion)
- Use for: chicken breast, fish fillet, steak, tofu

### 🍚 Bowl Foods
- **1 bowl** = ~300g (standard rice/cereal bowl)
- Use for: rice, pasta, soup, noodles, cereal

### 🍕 Slices
- **1 slice** = ~30g (one slice)
- Use for: pizza, bread, cake, pie

### 🥜 Handfuls
- **1 handful** = ~30g (what fits in your palm)
- Use for: chips, nuts, dried fruit, candy

### 📏 Size-Based
- **Small** = ~80g (smaller than usual)
- **Medium** = ~150g (typical portion)
- **Large** = ~250g (generous portion)

## Real-World Examples

### Breakfast
```
✓ "1 cup" of iced matcha latte
✓ "2 pieces" of toast  
✓ "1 piece" of banana
✓ "2 pieces" of eggs (for 2 eggs)
```

### Lunch
```
✓ "1 piece" of bulgogi egg cheese sandwich
✓ "1 cup" of orange juice
✓ "handful" of chips on the side
```

### Dinner
```
✓ "1 serving" of grilled chicken
✓ "1 bowl" of rice
✓ "medium" portion of broccoli
```

### Snacks
```
✓ "1 piece" of apple
✓ "handful" of almonds
✓ "1 slice" of pizza
✓ "small" yogurt
```

## Tips for Accuracy

1. **Be consistent** - Always use the same portion size for similar foods
2. **Start medium** - When unsure, choose "medium" or "1 serving"
3. **Adjust over time** - If you find you're consistently over/under, adjust your typical portions
4. **Use grams when available** - Kitchen scale at home? Use exact measurements
5. **Round up** - Better to overestimate slightly than underestimate

## Converting from Grams (if you know them)

If you happen to know the weight:
- 50-80g → Small or 1 piece
- 100-150g → Medium or 1 serving  
- 200-250g → Large
- 250-350g → Bowl or large

## Common Portion Mistakes

❌ **Don't say**: "150g of latte" (who measures drinks in grams?)  
✅ **Do say**: "1 cup of latte"

❌ **Don't say**: "85g of sandwich" (unrealistic)  
✅ **Do say**: "1 piece of sandwich"

❌ **Don't say**: "12g of chips" (too precise for a snack)  
✅ **Do say**: "handful of chips"

## Remember

This is about **tracking trends**, not perfect precision. Consistency matters more than exact accuracy!
